[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rholder/guava-retrying.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rholder/guava-retrying)

##What is this?
The guava-retrying module provides a general purpose method for retrying arbitrary Java code with specific stop, retry,
and exception handling capabilities that are enhanced by Guava's predicate matching.

This is a fork of the excellent RetryerBuilder code posted [here](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=490)
by Jean-Baptiste Nizet (JB).  I've added a Gradle build for pushing it up to my little corner of Maven Central so that
others can easily pull it into their existing projects with minimal effort.  It also includes an
[exponential backoff WaitStrategy](http://rholder.github.com/guava-retrying/com/github/rholder/retry/WaitStrategies.html)
that might be useful for situations where more well-behaved service polling is preferred.

##Maven
```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.rholder</groupId>
      <artifactId>guava-retrying</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.3</version>
    </dependency>
```

##Gradle
```groovy
    compile "com.github.rholder:guava-retrying:1.0.3"
```

##Quickstart
A minimal sample of some of the functionality would look like:

```java
    Callable<Boolean> callable = new Callable<Boolean>() {
        public Boolean call() throws Exception {
            return true; // do something useful here
        }
    };

    Retryer<Boolean> retryer = RetryerBuilder.<Boolean>newBuilder()
            .retryIfResult(Predicates.<Boolean>isNull())
            .retryIfExceptionOfType(IOException.class)
            .retryIfRuntimeException()
            .withStopStrategy(StopStrategies.stopAfterAttempt(3))
            .build();
    try {
        retryer.call(callable);
    } catch (RetryException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (ExecutionException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
```

##Exponential Backoff
Create a Retryer that retries forever, waiting after every failed retry in increasing exponential backoff intervals
until at most 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, retry from then on in 5 minute intervals.

```java
    Retryer<Boolean> retryer = RetryerBuilder.<Boolean>newBuilder()
            .retryIfExceptionOfType(IOException.class)
            .retryIfRuntimeException()
            .withWaitStrategy(WaitStrategies.exponentialWait(100, 5, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
            .withStopStrategy(StopStrategies.neverStop())
            .build();
```

##Documentation
Javadoc can be found [here](http://rholder.github.com/guava-retrying/).

##Building from source
The guava-retrying module uses a [Gradle](http://gradle.org)-based build system. In the instructions
below, [`./gradlew`](http://vimeo.com/34436402) is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as
a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build. The only
prerequisites are [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and JDK 1.6+.

### check out sources
`git clone git://github.com/rholder/guava-retrying.git`

### compile and test, build all jars
`./gradlew build`

### install all jars into your local Maven cache
`./gradlew install`
